# Server_RPI

The RPI runs 2 python programs, the first program is the serial receiver which runs continuously.The second program is the uploader which will be scheduled with Cron once a day.The Serial receiver will receive the raw data through USB connection.  The date will be addedand then the data will be written to a text file.  This text file functions as a small local database.The uploader program will be executed once a day.  It will read the local database, calculate thetotal amount of water used for each tap for each day and then upload this to the online database.  Itis obvious that this can only be executed when a network connection is present.  Since the networkin The Gambia is not stable it can occur that the RPI wonâ€™t be able to upload for a few days.To solve this problem the local database is able to save data of multiple days, and the uploader iscapable of uploading multiple days at once.  The actions of the uploader will be written to a logfile.
